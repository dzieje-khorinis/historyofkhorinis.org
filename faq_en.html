<div class="cd-faq-content" style="display: block;">
<p>The project is a game prequel, 10 years before the plot of the game and BEFORE the creation of the Magic Barrier. Everything in that project is non-profit, so it means that we do not collect any money for our work. Thanks to courtesy of friends we have access to <b> professional </b> sound development studios. <br> <br> The entire project is characterized by <b> maximum </b> compatibility with the world of Gothic game <br> <br> Before reading, watch the videos on the channel, this is the most important: <br> <br></p>

<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> When the History of Khorinis will be released? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Unfortunately, we <b>CANNOT</b> estimate the release date at this very moment. We are working hard, polishing every details and there are 50 actors left to prepare voice-overs. We are arranging with the recording studios – which are help us in our project for free - individually. The same thing goes with all people, who are helping us. The problem is that a big company can rent a recording studio and hire actors for a month. So it is IMPOSSIBLE to estimate the one true release date, because NOBODY has ever made a project on big scale in a non-profit way.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will the addon be paid/free? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>The addon will be <b>COMPLETELY</b> free and it will be available to download from our website.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do I need a original Gothic to play? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes. You must have a Gothic 2 Night of the Raven.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Does Piranha Bytes know of this? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, they liked our official Facebook profile! <br><img width="100%" src="images/PB_DK.png"></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">On what stage is the production of the addon? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Our addon is in the condition of putting all elements together – we are rewriting scripts into game code, placing the characters to the finished world and adding the voice-overs instantly on the same stage. We do not throw any release dates, because we do not know it will last two months, or eight. There are approximated date, but there are many things, which are impossible to estimate.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will there be any graphical improvements? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>We want that even the players with low-end hardware could have a fun from our addon, so that’s why we are going to put a possibility to install DirectX 11 wrapper into the addon installer. Moreover, we are creating our production, to make look minimally better on the “normal” Gothic, but we are also creating a graphic, which cooperates with DirectX 11, so it allows to make better effects.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">For how many years has the project been in development? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>A concept to the History of Khorinis came to mind in 2008, but the project was supposed to look different than now. There is practically NOTHING from that period what could be used now. The History of Khorinis, which is currently in development, is being made from practically ZERO to ALMOST 2 years! Currently we are on the best way to finish the project.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will we translate addon to other languages? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, we're planning to in-house translate addon and we'll share translating tools for everyone who want to help us. At this moment we can confirm translations to <b>Polish</b>, <b>English</b>, <b>German</b>, <b>Russian</b> and <b>Italian</b>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you already have experience with similar projects? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Some of the team members are working or worked in the largest Polish and global IT, movie and electronic companies such as <b> Microsoft </b>, <b> Nokia </b>, <b> Autodesk </b> or <b> Polish Filmmakers Association </b></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I play in Steam/GOG? </a>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What will be the factions/guilds? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p><b>City Guard</b> and <b> Merchant Guild Mercenary </b>. Mages will not be a faction you can join.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul id="world" class="cd-faq-group"> <li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>World </h2></li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> How big is the new island compared to the Khorinis island? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Both, the island and city of Vaduz are around 2x the size of their equivalents on Khorinis. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will there be any snow biomes on Vaduz? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>No, the island is all green ;) </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What about the castle in the Valley of Mines? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>The castle will be restored to its former glory, no more broken towers! </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will there be any mages' monastery on the island? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will the monastery in the Valley of Mines look slightly more intact? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will there be a possibility to explore Jharkendar? </a>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What about Inubis' tomb near Onar's farm? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul id="gameplay" class="cd-faq-group"> <li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Gameplay </h2></li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> How could the path of a mage not be accessible? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>By creating another, separate story path, we would be only stuck with additional work on balancing, that would only delay the release of our mod. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> How many hours of gameplay will be there? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Around the same as it was in G2 with its addon. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will one be able to become a mage/necromancer? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will the looks of the character change as he's getting stronger? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Are you planning to add dual wielding to the mod? </a>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> How will the cooking system work? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Are NPCs going to react/comment our actions in the game? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Of course! </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What about ore mining? It looked really unfinished in G2. </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>There will be a lot of things to mine in our mod! </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will there be any quests started by; e.g. reading a note in some mine? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, you won't be disappointed. </p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul id="other" class="cd-faq-group"> <li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Others </h2></li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What are the system requirements? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>We haven't finished yet so it would be unwise to say for sure. The mod will probably need around 2GB of free space, but you will run it on any PC that could handle Gothic 2 NotR. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> How much space will be needed on hard drive? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will one take part in Lee's drama? </a>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will one be able to hear swear words in new dialogues? </a>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will there be a pleasure house on Vaduz? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will there be women with various professions on Vaduz? Alchemist, sorceress etc. </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>There will be no such women for the same reasons as there were no female paladins in G2. There are SOME important women on Vaduz – nothing too radical. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will there be any faction-neutral armour in the mod (like Leather or Crawler Plate ones)? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Are you still planning to recreate Gothic Sequel factions? </a>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What about the Seekers? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Only people who couldn't resist the dark influence of Beliar and the Sleeper became them, so they won't be seen in our mod. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Are you bringing Vino's distillery into play? </a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

</div>
</li>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Before the fall of the barrier, Khorinis wasn't flooded with bandits. Will there be any of them in the mod? </a>

</li>
<li>
