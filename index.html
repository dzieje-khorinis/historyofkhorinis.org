        <h1>Information</h1>
        Myrtana, the Vaduz Island, not long before the creation of magic barrier and not long after the beginning of war with orcs. Thanks to the fate, leading a rather monotonous life, Lars becomes a participant in the event that changes everything. In mysterious circumstances, twelve of the most powerful mages of the kingdom led by famous Grandmaster of Fire, Xardas, arrive on the island. No one knows, what they are doing there. The only thing that is known is that soon they plan to continue their journey.
        <p>
        Lars, after helping the mages, will receive a proposition to travel with them to the Khorinis Island. Wizards are going to create there a magic barrier to isolate prisoners from the outside world, at least that's what they say. Our hero will receive different tasks (not only from the mages), which may be a real challenge for a player.

        <h2>Character and world</h2>
        Lars is a young man, who with his father(a former soldier of royal army), has a small blacksmith shop near the city of Vaduz. His father, apart from teaching him the profession, helps him in combat skills. His dream is that his son will find some peaceful job and that he won't take part in any battles.
        <p>
        He himself, as a veteran of wars with orcs, doesn't deal well with the trauma. After smallpox and death of his wife he drinks a lot getting himself in more trouble. However, as it appears the worst is yet to come...
        <p>
        Mages arrive on the island and after you fulfill a task given by them, they offer you collaboration and going with them on the Khorinis Island. What will we find there? The old harbor known from Gothic 2 will be unrecognizable. Dozens moored ships, sailors, traders, knights, prisoners and travelers will fill the whole harbor neighborhood. Apart from that, the whole city will be refreshed and extended. The Khorinis Island itself will also look different: all burned down houses and destroyed constructions will look as new, there will be more roads, a few times more people, more households, inns and other interesting objects.
        <p>
        The Valley of Mines also will look differently. The Old Camp, once in ruin, now will look as brand new, mountain fortress and collapsed mines will be full of life. There will be a few mines and not only in the Valley of Mines, but also on Khorinis. Of course, acces to the Valley of Mines will be restricted, not anyone will be able to enter. Safe conduct pass will be needed.
